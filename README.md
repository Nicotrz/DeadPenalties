## Code structure

This code is meant to show a correct usage of the Inheritance.
For example, main characteristics of a weapon are on the Weapon class:
```Swift
    //Number of weapon currently available ( Fist is not included..Not really a weapon)
    static let numberOfWeapon = 7
    
    //Does the weapon give point?
    let givePoints: Bool
    //How many points are impacted?
    let affectedPoints: Int
    //What is the type ( name ) of the weapon?
    var type: String
    //Is this a magical weapon?
    let magicalWeapon: Bool
    //How many Mana points are impacted?
    let affectedMana: Int
    //Can the weapon be used more than once?
    let oneTimeWeapon: Bool
```
But all the more precises characteristics are on the child classes. Example with the Sword class:
```Swift
class Sword: Weapon {
    //Caracteristics of the sword
    static let type = "Sword ‚öîÔ∏è"
    static let givePoints = false
    static let magicalWeapon = false
    static let affectedMana = 0
    static let affectedPoints = 10
    static let description = "This Weapon take \(Sword.affectedPoints) points from the opponent"
    static let oneTimeWeapon = false
```
